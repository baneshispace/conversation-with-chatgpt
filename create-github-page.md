To create a website from a repository full of markdown (`.md`) files, you have several options. You can use static site generators, which convert markdown files into HTML pages and provide an easy way to maintain and navigate your content.

Here are a few popular options, along with a brief description of each:

### 1. **Jekyll (GitHub Pages compatible)**
   - **Description**: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator that's well-integrated with GitHub Pages. It uses markdown for content and Liquid templates for layouts.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Install Jekyll (`gem install jekyll bundler`).
     2. Create a new site (`jekyll new your-site`).
     3. Add your markdown files to the `_posts` or any folder you create.
     4. Customize your layout with HTML/CSS.
     5. Deploy to GitHub Pages.
